            bio: "\tGT Independence is a family-built, disability-led financial management services (FMS) company dedicated to helping people live the life they choose, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe company began when the Carmichael family searched for support for their oldest son, Ben, and asked a simple but transformative question: Why can’t people with disabilities live independently in their own homes and communities?\n\nThat question grew into a mission and ultimately into GT Independence.\n\nFounded in 2004 in Sturgis, Michigan, GT Independence has grown from a single family’s vision into a national leader serving tens of thousands of people across the United States.\n\nToday, the company supports Self-Direction programs in 19 states and Washington, D.C., empowering people to hire their own caregivers, manage their own services, and maintain control over their daily lives.\n\nGT is proudly disability-owned and led, with a workforce that reflects the diversity of the people it serves.\n\nBuilt on the values of inclusion, respect, and family, the organization remains committed to helping people direct their own long-term care and support services so they can live the life of their choosing.",
